**Challenges**

-**Morning**

  **[Solo Project] IMDB Clone**

  Build an IMDB clone with React using the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

  In the Lil' Twitter challenge, a design was provided to you, which you componentized. In this project, you will focus on design -- specifically you will focus on UI and software design using React.

  This project, intentionally, has very little instructions. Artists and Software Developers are no different. [What is Art anyway?](http://panw.weebly.com/programming/what-is-art). To me, it's just an expression with an intent therefore making everything art. As a Software Developer, you will not always be provided with very clear specifications. As an artist, you use your imagination and ask questions.

  Have fun!

- **Afternoon (If you finish IMDB Clone)**

  **[Pair Project] Stack Overflow Clone**
  This project would be exactly the same from P2 - make sure to use polymorphic associations and make it better.

  The focus of this project is to better utilize React's compositional style and see some of the benefits first-hand.
